                            <p>A land lease agreement is a contract between a landowner and a tenant, where the landowner agrees to lease a piece of land to the tenant for a specified period. The tenant pays rent to the landowner for the use of the land, and the agreement typically outlines details such as the duration of the lease, the rent amount, permitted land use, maintenance responsibilities, and termination conditions. It's essential to draft such agreements carefully and with legal consultation to ensure clarity and protection for both parties involved.</p>

                            <p style="max-width: 100%;">The two main types of land leases are subordinated and unsubordinated, although unsubordinated leases are much more common because they provide more rights to the owner of the land.</p>
                            
                            <p style="max-width: 100%;">
                                In an unsubordinated lease, the property owner retains the top priority of claims on the land even if the tenant defaults on a loan for improvements. This might make it more difficult for someone to obtain mortgage financing to build or improve on a home on that land.</p>
                                
                                <p style="max-width: 100%;">
In a subordinated lease, however, the property owner takes a lower position for claims on the property if the tenant defaults on the mortgage, which can put the home equity at risk. The landowner can also increase the rental rate to compensate for the risk in this scenario.

  <p style="max-width: 100%;">Buying a home on a leased property could cost less than buying a single-family home outright because you’re not paying for the land. Also, if you’re going to live in a property that’s on the land and possibly improve it, you could try to get a deal on the cost of the lease.</p>

  <p style="max-width: 100%;">It’s also possible you could avoid paying the full property tax bill each year, but it depends on how much the property owner wants to charge you for that expense. You might be asked to pay it as part of your contract.</p>

  <p style="max-width: 100%;">If you move into a land-lease community, you could get amenities such as a recreation center or pool as part of the overall cost of living there.</p>
                            
                             <h6 class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-2 ltn__secondary-color mt-5">Cons</h6>   
 
 <p style="max-width: 100%;"> There are some cons to land-lease agreements, however. A lender might not want to give you a mortgage on an unsubordinated lease if they are going to have fewer rights to recover their investment than the landowner.</p>

 <p style="max-width: 100%;">You also might not know whether there are environmental issues with the land, or where the potential property encroachments are, as an example.</p>

 <p style="max-width: 100%;">Another risk is if the lease is up, the owners can kick you off the property. If you know when a lease period ends—either for your agreement with the landowner or the land owner’s personal lease—you could try to prepare for what happens next. But it takes plenty of money and time to plan and execute a move. This can pose a major problem if you’re not prepared for it.</p>
